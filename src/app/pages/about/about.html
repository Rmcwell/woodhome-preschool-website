            Wood Home Preschool was founded in 1995 by Jane Wood, a
            passionate educator with over 20 years of experience in early
            childhood education. What began as a small home-based preschool
            has grown into a beloved institution in our community.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            Our mission is to provide a nurturing and stimulating
            environment where children can develop a lifelong love of
            learning. We believe that each child is unique and deserves an
            education tailored to their individual needs and interests.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            Over the years, we have helped hundreds of children build strong
            foundations for future academic success while fostering social
            skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence.
